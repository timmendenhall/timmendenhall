            <h2>What's a Node Anyways?</h2>
            <p>So what is Node.js anyways?  If you haven't heard of it by now, then you can think of it as a modular, non-blocking io, powerful framework for building web servers of any variety and size.  Also, the best part is it runs by reading your javascript code and even comes with a package manager (npm) with access to an unlimited number resources.  If you don't know what a package manager is don't sweat it, we'll learn more as we go.</p>
            <h2>Installing Node</h2>
            <p>Your options for installation will vary depending on which operating system you're running.  But, have no fear as the fine people of Joyent have some amazing installation instructions.  Let's head over to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js's website</a> now.</p>
            <p>Currently your options are going to be either 4.X.X or 5.X.X.  It shouldn't really matter which one you choose.  But, I'll be using 5.0.0 during the time of writing this tutorial.</p>
            <p>If you're a Mac user, you may prefer to install Node.js with Homebrew.  This is my preferred method as it's a single command to then update my Node.js install.</p>
            <p>To be continued...</p>
