            <h2>Baby Steps</h2>
            <p>Ever wanted to make your own web application?  Ever wonder which is better unidirectional or bidirectional data flow?  Don't even know what that means?  As long as you answered a resounding "Yes!" to the first question, then this series is for you.</p>
            <p>We're going to focus on various bite size chunks.  These chunks can be taken individually for learning a new technology.  Or you can follow along and deploy your very own web application.</p>
            <p>But, even I must go through some of my own baby steps as I am not only maintaining the content for the blog, but, also I'll be coding it along the way!</p>
            <h2>What exactly is this made with?</h2>
            <p>I'm glad you asked!  I will first focus the blog series on the same technologies running this site including: Node.js, React JS, React Router, Redux, Webpack, deploying on Amazon Web Services and more!</p>
