            <h2>Baby Steps</h2>
            <p>Ever wanted to make your own web application?  Ever wonder which is better unidirectional or bidirectional data flow?  Don't even know what that means?  As long as you answered a resounding "Yes!" to the first question, then this series is for you.</p>
            <p>We're going to focus on various bite size chunks.  These chunks can be taken individually for learning a new technology.  Or you can follow along and deploy your very own web application.</p>
            <p>But, even I must go through some of my own baby steps as I am not only maintaining the content for the blog, but, also I'll be coding it along the way!</p>
            <h2>What exactly is this made with?</h2>
            <p>I'm glad you asked!  I will first focus the blog series on the same technologies running this site including: Node.js, React JS, React Router, Redux, Webpack, deploying on Amazon Web Services and more!</p>

            <h2>What's a Node Anyways?</h2>
            <p>So what is Node.js anyways?  If you haven't heard of it by now, then you can think of it as a modular, non-blocking io, powerful framework for building web servers of any variety and size.  Also, the best part is it runs by reading your javascript code and even comes with a package manager (npm) with access to an unlimited number resources.  If you don't know what a package manager is don't sweat it, we'll learn more as we go.</p>
            <h2>Installing Node</h2>
            <p>Your options for installation will vary depending on which operating system you're running.  But, have no fear as the fine people of Joyent have some amazing installation instructions.</p>
